# LiNEAR


### Liquid Staking Workflow

1. Users deposit $NEAR into the liquid staking pool, in exchange for $LiNEAR, which represents the usersâ€™ share of the pool.
2. Liquid staking pool then delegate deposited $NEAR to NEAR validator nodes.
3. $NEAR staking rewards accumulate in the pool.
4. $LiNEAR appreciates against $NEAR over time.
