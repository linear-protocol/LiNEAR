/**
 * Welcome to near-workspaces-ava!
 *
 * This is a working test which checks the functionality of [the status-message
 * contract][1]. For quick reference, here's the contract's implementation:
 *
 *     impl StatusMessage {
 *         pub fn set_status(&mut self, message: String) {
 *             let account_id = env::signer_account_id();
 *             self.records.insert(&account_id, &message);
 *         }

 *         pub fn get_status(&self, account_id: String) -> Option<String> {
 *             return self.records.get(&account_id);
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 * As you can see, this contract only has two methods, a setter and a getter.
 * The setter sets a status message for the account that signed the call to the
 * contract. The getter accepts an `account_id` param and returns the status for
 * that account.
 *
 * The tests below create a local blockchain with this contract deployed to
 * one account and two more accounts which store statuses in the contract.

/**
 * Start off by importing Workspace from near-workspaces-ava.
 */
import {Workspace} from 'near-workspaces-ava';

/**
 * Initialize a new workspace. In local sandbox mode, this will:
 *
 *   - Create a new local blockchain
 *   - Create the root account for that blockchain (see `root` below)
 *   - Execute any actions passed to the function
 *   - Shut down the newly created blockchain, but *save the data*
 */
const workspace = Workspace.init(async ({root}) => {
  // Create a subaccount of the root account, like `alice.sandbox`
  // (the actual account name is not guaranteed; you can get it with `alice.accountId`)
  const alice = await root.createAccount('alice');

  // Create a subaccount of the root account, and also deploy a contract to it
  const contract = await root.createAndDeploy(
    // Subaccount name
    'status-message',

    // Relative path (from package.json location) to the compiled contract file
    // which will be deployed to this account
    'compiled-contracts/status_message.wasm',

    // Provide `method` and `args` to call in the same transaction as the deploy
    // {
    //   method: 'init',
    //   args: {owner_id: root},
    // },
  );

  // You can call any contract methods that you want executed before the
  // beginning of all subsequent tests. In this example, Alice sets her status.
  // Don't forget to `await` your calls!
  await alice.call(contract, 'set_status', {message: 'hello'});

  // Return the accounts that you want available in subsequent tests
  // (`root` is always available)
  return {alice, contract};
});

/**
 * Now you can write some tests! In local sandbox mode, each `workspace.test` will:
 *
 *   - start a new local blockchain
 *   - copy the state from the blockchain created in `Workspace.init`
 *   - get access to the accounts created in `Workspace.init` using the same variable names
 *   - run concurrently with all other `workspace.test` calls, keeping data isolated
 *   - shut down at the end, forgetting all new data created
 *
 * It's also worth knowing that `workspace.test` is syntax sugar added by
 * near-workspaces-ava. With raw AVA + near-workspaces, here's how to write a test:
 *
 *     import avaTest from 'ava';
 *     import {Workspace} from 'near-workspaces';
 *     // Alternatively, you can import Workspace and ava both from near-workspaces-ava:
 *     // import {ava as avaTest, Workspace} from 'near-workspaces-ava';
 *
 *     const workspace = Workspace.init(...);
 *
 *     avaTest('root sets status', async test => {
 *       await workspace.fork(async ({contract, root}) => {
 *         ...
 *       });
 *     });
 *
 * Instead, with the syntax sugar, you can write this as you see it below â€“
 * saving an indentation level and avoiding one extra `await`.
 * (Extra credit: try rewriting this test using the "sugar-free" syntax.)
